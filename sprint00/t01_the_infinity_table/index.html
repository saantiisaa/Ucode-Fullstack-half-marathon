        <td>The significance of this MCU Infinity Stone can be observed in the fact that, apart from Doctor Strange, no other MCU Phase 4 character can replace the abilities of the Soul Stone.
            The Soul Stone was the most mysterious of the MCU Infinity Stones prior to its eventual reveal in Avengers: Infinity War, as there was no setup or hint of its origins.
            Infinity War reveals that Thanos once sent Gamora to find the stone but she decided not to reveal that she found it on the planet Vormir.

        <td>The Time Stone plays a major role in Doctor Strange.
            The stone is housed in the Eye Of Agamotto, which was created by Earth’s first Sorcerer Supreme.
            Even though the Eye of Agamotto was reserved for the Sorcerer Supremes, Stephen Strange studies the Stone and its powers while training.
            Strange's ambition is chastised, but it helps him rewind time and trap Dormammu in a time loop after Kaecilius threatens to bring the Dark Dimension to Earth, forcing the creature to abandon his plans of conquest.

        <td>The Space Stone, the first Infinity Stone to appear in the MCU in the form of the Tesseract, caused a lot of trouble throughout the Infinity Saga.
            In Captain America: The First Avenger, Red Skull retrieves it from Tønsberg, Norway, and uses it to build futuristic weapons for Hydra.
            After the Tesseract teleports Red Skull to Vormir, SHIELD retrieves the weapon and studies it to create their own weapons through Howard Stark's Project PEGASUS.

            This allows Loki to control the minds of Hawkeye and Dr. Selvig.
            In Avengers: Age Of Ultron, the Stone is revealed to have some kind of intelligence inside it that is used to create Ultron and give the Maximoff Twins their Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver superpowers.

            Malekith and his Dark Elves attempt to wield the Reality Stone's power during The Convergence —
            an event where all the Nine Realms align once every five thousand years, allowing Malekith to use the Reality Stone in the form of the Aether to bring the whole universe into a state of complete darkness.

            Thousands of years later, it was found encased inside an Orb on the planet Morag, where Peter Quill retrieves it to make a quick buck.
            Ronan the Accuser seeks it for Thanos but steals it for himself to destroy the planet Xandar and is eventually defeated by the Guardians.
